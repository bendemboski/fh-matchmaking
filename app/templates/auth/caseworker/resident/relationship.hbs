      â€œI am concerned with the increasing rate of Seattle's homeless population, and I want to become a part of the solution. I heard about The BLOCK Project on NPR and immediately followed up. I think this is an excellent way to chip away at homelessness. I have a large property lot -- so why not put it to good use? -- Najja, third BLOCK Host
